# AP Computer Science A (JAVA) <br/> Final Project

Represents a game of pacman written in Java

Base was written fully from the tutorial provided by the teacher

What I did is just small additions and changes to the code

Implemented features:

- Game over screen
- Moving across whole map and turning randomly at intersections
- 3 more rooms with different layouts
- Algorithm that follows pacman when theres 10% of food left on the map
- Cherries are healing the player and appear when theres 1 lives left
